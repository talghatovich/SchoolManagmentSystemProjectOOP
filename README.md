# SchoolManagmentSystem
Hello!

The project is created for OOP course endterm. 

The system helps organize the things related to school in Online. Students, parents are users and they have their own Logins 
and passwords, respectively. The login logic was based on FirstName_LastName_Id scheme, while password is "123" 
by default(it is for users). Also we have admin. He is not user. He administrates the system and his login 
is simply "admin", password is "Qwerty123!".

If you want to check the project by yourself, firstly you have to implement our database that is provided in a textfile. Instead of
importing it, you should copypast the statements and database will appear. Then you can look for information of users from there.

We have created it in a team.
Our team is Rafael Baimurzin, Nurassyl Shaken, and Arlan Aitpayev.
You can contact us in a telegram by nicks: @talghatovich , @RafaelloB , @nurassyln .
